# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

### React Native App
React Native app to find jobs. Followed a tutorial linked below, really positive experience learning full stack development and how to deploy an app for iOS and Andriod. Will certainly be useful for the project going forwards. 

Here is the homepage and the search page for the app. It felt very fluid to use, normal apple gestures worked on it like swiping left to right to go back.

### Firebase Authentication
This Firebase page is very basic but has all the proper linkages to the backend that allow us to track users and allow for various means of signing into our webpage. We can also use Firebase for analytics, which may come in handy for our project.

### Bootstrap 5 Portfolio Site
This Bootstrap 5-based mock portfolio site is the most beautiful design I have made yet. It utilizes normal stylesheets in tandem with Bootstrap 5 and Google fonts/icons, which replicates the real world situation, where we are unlikely to simply rely on one resource for styling.

## Who Did What?

Sam worked on the native react app to learn some more react native. Ryan worked on researching the best solution to our security problem as the base, which then led to working on a project that implements Firebase as the means for individual authorization to access their data in an app. This initial project ended faster than expected, so he learned about Bootstrap as well.

## What you learned

### Sam
What worked: Fantastic tutorial learning to build the app from scratch, really cool to have a working search function in the app with real job information (subject to API calls) 

What didn't work: Somewhat frustrating buggy expo system using the phone for live debugging of the code, had to keep refreshing. Having such a limited number of API calls was also frustrating.

### Ryan
What worked: Both tutorials provided project guidelines so that I not only learn the technical aspects of Firebase and Bootstrap but apply them immediately for reinforced learning. The Firebase tutorial succinctly taught me how to integrate email/password and Google authorization. I have a good grasp of what makes these components work and how to adapt them to our team's app (just depends on our design language). The Bootstrap 5 tutorial gave me a good idea of how to use the style elements to design the essentials of any website (navbar, footer, inner content sections). I could see our team using Firebase for signing in users into our app and Bootstrap 5 as our framework for styling.

What didn't work: Some of the links in the tutorials were dated, requiring me to spend additional time to track down working links. Also, the Firebase tutorial began to lose relevance towards the middle section, prompting me to find the second tutorial for learning new skills.
